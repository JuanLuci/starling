# Starling performance: what was measured, what was ruled out, what is left

Notes from a session of measurements on 2026-10-28, for whoever looks for a way to make Starling (the
Android port, branch `android`) draw faster. Read this before measuring again: it says what the numbers
are, which ideas they already ruled out, and how to build and try a change on the phone in minutes.

## The phone and how the numbers were taken

- POCO F6 Pro (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, Adreno 740, 3200x1440, 120 Hz), Android 16, Starling 0.1.2 release
  (`--profile fast`), Vulkan, Mailbox present mode.
- Numbers are the in-game overlay's (F3-style stats in the corner): fps, frame, `cpu` (render thread's
  work per frame), `gpu` (the frame's GPU time from the timestamp queries), chunks, draw calls, CPU MHz.
- A YouTube picture-in-picture window was open during most shots: it uses some GPU and CPU.
- Test APKs installed with the quick profile (`build_apk.py` default) build `horizon-client` and
  `horizon-android` at **opt-level 1**: never measure with them. Use `--profile fast` (what releases use).

## Measurements

Presets (graphics.rs `apply_preset`): Performance = render distance 8, no clouds, no cutout leaves;
Quality = render distance 16, fancy clouds, cutout leaves, biome blend 2, mipmaps 4.

| Scene | Distance | Resolution | fps | cpu | gpu | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Grass field, Performance | 8 | 100% | 138 | 4.6 ms | 5.8 ms | 2 draw calls (flat draws) |
| Island, Performance, no clouds | 8 | 100% | 161 | 3.9 ms | 5.1 ms | |
| Island, Performance, fancy clouds | 8 | 100% | 144 | 4.7 ms | 4.8 ms | clouds ~free at 8 |
| Island, Quality, no clouds | 16 | 100% | 68 | 6.0 ms | 13.5 ms | 40 draw calls, 806 sections |
| Island, Quality, fast clouds | 16 | 100% | 66 | 6.2 ms | 14.0 ms | |
| Island, Quality, fancy clouds | 16 | 100% | 56 | 7.7 ms | 16.5 ms | fancy clouds ~3 ms at 16 |
| Sky only (3 sections) | 16 | 100% | 259 | 2.9 ms | 2.4 ms | sky + HUD + full-screen passes |
| Grass field, Balanced | 12 | 50% | 108-121 | 6.3-7.8 ms | 6.4-6.6 ms | |

Resolution sweep, island, Quality, distance 16, no clouds (on the no-cutout test build below, about
1 ms under the release at 100%):

| Resolution | Pixels | gpu |
|---|---|---|
| 100% | 1 | 12.5 ms |
| 75% | 0.56 | 9.8 ms |
| 50% | 0.25 | 7.5 ms |
| 25% | 0.06 | 6.3 ms |

This fits `gpu = 5.9 ms + 6.6 ms x pixels`: about **6 ms that do not depend on the resolution** (the
terrain's geometry for ~880 sections, plus the HUD and the final upscale; the sky-only shot puts the
non-terrain part at 2.4 ms at most) and **6.6 ms of pixels** at full resolution (7.5 with the cutout).

The CPU never went past **1.6 of 3.19 GHz**: `android_lib.rs` `frame_hint` tells ADPF a target of 120 fps
even with Max Framerate on Unlimited (`cap.unwrap_or(120)`), so the scheduler keeps the clock low while
frames fit.

The "1% low" stayed between 10 and 47 fps and the worst frame between 13 and 29 ms in every shot: frame
spikes, not looked into yet.

## Ruled out

- **Opaque terrain apart from cutout terrain** (so solid blocks draw with a shader without `discard`
  and the tiler's early depth test / LRZ works). Every solid quad draws with `fs_solid`
  (`terrain.wgsl`), which discards below alpha 0.5. A build with **no discard at all** (branch
  `exp/opaque-terrain`, never merged) cut the island's GPU time from 13.5 to 12.4 ms (8%): not worth
  the change across every draw path (flat, indirect, culling phases, shadows, LOD tiles).
- **GPU occlusion culling**: off on Android on purpose (`gfx.rs`, before `cull_on`): measured on an
  Adreno 740 it saved no GPU time, and a block placed or broken sometimes left terrain out.
- **LOD Distance** (`lod_distance`): draws simplified terrain beyond the render distance, which adds
  work, it does not take any away.
- Terrain sampling is `Nearest` without anisotropy; the vertex is ~24 bytes (`TERRAIN_ATTRIBUTES`).

## Cheap, but they do not make the heavy case faster

- ADPF target 240 when uncapped (CPU clock up): helps CPU-bound scenes only.
- LTO for releases (`[profile.release]` is thin LTO, codegen-units 1; releases use `fast`, no LTO,
  because LTO ran the runner out of memory before the swap step): a few percent of CPU.
- `apply_mobile_defaults` (graphics.rs) caps phones at **60 fps** on purpose (cooler). A player who
  changes nothing plays at 60 even on a 144 Hz screen: the likely reason another Android fork was
  reported at 144 fps "with the same settings" against Starling's 60-70.

## Ideas not tried, for the GPU at distance 16

1. **Far rings as LOD meshes**: the LOD tile meshes exist; drawing them for the outer chunks of the
   render distance (say 9 to 16) instead of full sections would cut much of the ~6 ms of geometry.
2. **Greedy meshing**: sprites are layers of a texture array sampled with `Repeat`, so coplanar
   neighbouring faces with the same texture, tint and light could merge into one quad (flat ground,
   water). Smooth lighting and AO limit where it applies.
3. **A smaller vertex** (24 to ~16 bytes): positions section-local in 16 bits; shader packs read the
   layout, so they need care.
4. **The pixels**: whether the full-screen sky (`sky_along_ray` per pixel) or the water costs more
   than it should; a lower default resolution on phones (Bedrock does that).

## How to try a change on the phone

- **A test APK that installs over the release** (keeps the phone's data): push a branch, then
  `gh workflow run android.yml --repo JuanLuci/starling --ref <branch> -f release_key=true`. It signs
  with the release key and builds with the fast profile, does not publish, and the artifact is kept one
  day (`gh run download <id> -R JuanLuci/starling -n starling-apk`). About 11 minutes.
- **adb**: wireless debugging, the phone at home on 192.168.1.x (its address changes; the port too, the
  owner reads it off Developer options); `adb connect <ip>:<port>`, `adb install -r <apk>`. Xiaomi's
  "Install via USB" sometimes refuses an install without asking (`INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`):
  try again, or push the APK to `/sdcard/Download` for the owner to open. Warn the owner before
  installing anything; the phone is theirs and in use.
- **Logs**: `/storage/emulated/0/Starling/logs/latest.log` (and `previous.log`) over adb.
- **Measuring**: the same place, the same direction, the same settings, a screenshot of the overlay
  before and after; one change at a time. The island shots above are at a river with a small wooded
  island in a world the owner has.
- The Azure build VM (`starling-build`) builds and checks in a few minutes (`try_ref.sh`, see the
  project notes); deallocate it after use.
